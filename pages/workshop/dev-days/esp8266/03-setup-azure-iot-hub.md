In this lab, you will provision a new Azure IoT Hub. Once you have the IoT Hub created, you will be able to create a new Azure IoT device (a software reference to your physical device) that you will use to send telemetry to Azure.

# Bill of Materials
What you will need:

1. An Azure Account.

# Setup an Azure IoT Hub
{% include azure/setup-iot-hub.md %}

# Create a New Azure IoT Device using DeviceExplorer
{% include azure/new-device-deviceexplorer.md %}

For more information on how to use DeviceExplorer, the Project [deviceexplorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) is available on Github.

# Conclusion &amp; Next Steps
Congratulations! You have created an Azure IoT Hub that you will connect devices to. You also created a representation of a physical device in your IoT Hub. 

In the [next lab][nextlab], you'll deploy an Azure Web Site that uses D3.js to visualize the output of your Weather Station.
