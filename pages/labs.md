## [Getting Started][1]
This is a step-by-step guide to preparing your computer for the IoT Labs.
Estimated time to complete: 30-minutes

## [Writing Digital Output][2]
In this lab you will write to a digital output.
Estimated time to complete: 20-minutes

## [Reading Analog Input][3]
In this lab you will read input from an analog sensor using a voltage divider.
Estimated time to complete: 20-minutes

## [Input Controls Output][4]
In this lab you will use analog input to control digital output.
Estimated time to complete: 20-minutes

## [Sending Data to the Cloud][5]
In this lab you will build a simple ambient light detection app and send the data that is being collected to the Cloud.
Estimated time to complete: 30-minutes

## [Command &amp; Control][6]
In this lab you will build an Arduino circuit that acts as both a message sending device (an ambient light detector) and a command/control receiving device (LED). You will learn how to send command/control messages and how to process them. These are the concepts of connected Things."
Estimated time to complete: 40-minutes

## [Connecting Multiple Things][7]
Coming soon.

## [Visualizing IoT Data][8]
Coming soon.
