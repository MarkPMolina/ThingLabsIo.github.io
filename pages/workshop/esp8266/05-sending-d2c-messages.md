# Bill of Materials
What you will need:

1. The ThingLabs Weather Station created in the ['ThingLabs Weather' lab](../weather/).

# Connecting your Weather Station to the Cloud

This lab will show you how to restructure your existing simple application into an application that uses the MQTT protocol to send telemetry data to Azure. On the Azure side we're using the MQTT gateway to accept messages instead of the default AMQP protocol IoTHub's support.

From [Wikipedia's MQTT Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT):
    
> MQTT[1] (formerly MQ Telemetry Transport) is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC PRF 20922)[2] publish-subscribe based "light weight" messaging protocol for use on top of the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a "small code footprint" is required or the network bandwidth is limited. The publish-subscribe messaging pattern requires a message broker. The broker is responsible for distributing messages to interested clients based on the topic of a message. Andy Stanford-Clark and Arlen Nipper of Cirrus Link Solutions authored the first version of the protocol in 1999.

The structure of the [NodeMCU MQTT client](http://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/dev/en/modules/mqtt/) is documented to provide both telemetry and command processing. For this lab we focus just on telemetry. An example is provided from the NodeMCU documents:

{% highlight lua %}
-- init mqtt client with keepalive timer 120sec
m = mqtt.Client("clientid", 120, "user", "password")

-- setup Last Will and Testament (optional)
-- Broker will publish a message with qos = 0, retain = 0, data = "offline" 
-- to topic "/lwt" if client don't send keepalive packet
m:lwt("/lwt", "offline", 0, 0)

m:on("connect", function(client) print ("connected") end)
m:on("offline", function(client) print ("offline") end)

-- on publish message receive event
m:on("message", function(client, topic, data) 
  print(topic .. ":" ) 
  if data ~= nil then
    print(data)
  end
end)

-- for TLS: m:connect("192.168.11.118", secure-port, 1)
m:connect("192.168.11.118", 1883, 0, function(client) print("connected") end, 
                                     function(client, reason) print("failed reason: "..reason) end)

-- Calling subscribe/publish only makes sense once the connection
-- was successfully established. In a real-world application you want
-- move those into the 'connect' callback or make otherwise sure the 
-- connection was established.

-- subscribe topic with qos = 0
m:subscribe("/topic",0, function(client) print("subscribe success") end)
-- publish a message with data = hello, QoS = 0, retain = 0
m:publish("/topic","hello",0,0, function(client) print("sent") end)

m:close();
-- you can call m:connect again

Adapting this example, we have the program below that connects to the MQTT IoTHub Gateway and sets a timer to send telemetry every 1 second.

# Create the Lua Program in ESPlorer 

As in the previous lab, you'll write lua code in ESplorer. This code (below), operates the photocell and LED as a nightlight.

1. Launch ESPlorer.jar, select your serial port, and press the 'Open' button

2. Cut and Paste or write this code into the left side of the ESPlorer

        connected = false

        light = MAXLIGHT - adc.read(ADCPIN)
        
        status, temperature, humidity, temperature_dec, humidity_dec = dht.read(DHTPIN)
        if status == dht.OK then

# Run the App on the Device
To run the application you will save it to the ESP8266, reset the device, then invoke the code.

1. Press the button 'Save to ESP' on the lower left of the ESPlorer interface.
2. Push the reset button on the ES8266
3. When it's done booting, click the 'Reload' button on the right side.
   You should see a list of files on the ESP8266
4. Double click the file on the right hand side that you saved.
   This should execute your code.

## Monitor the Messages Being Received by Azure IoT Hub
Using the Device Explorer utility for Windows you installed in the [previous lab](../setup-azure-iot-hub/), you can monitor the messages being received in Azure IoT Hub.

1. Open the __Data__ tab.
2. Select the device from the drop-down list.
3. Click __Monitor__ to begin monitoring messages as they come into your Azure IoT Hub.

# Conclusion &amp; Next Steps
Congratulations! In this lab, you updated the __Weather Station__ application to send messages to Azure IoT Hub. The core concepts you've learned are:

1. Using the Azure IoT MQTT Gateway to receive data sent using MQTT to send device-to-cloud (D2C) messages.
2. Sending messages as a continuous stream (e.g. once per second from a continuously measuring sensor).

At this point, nothing interesting is happening in the cloud with that data you are sending to Azure. It is simply being persisted for a default amount of time (1-day) and then being dropped. In the [next lab][nextlab], you will create a web application to visualize the data.
