## [Getting Started][1]
This is a step-by-step guide to preparing your computer for the IoT Labs.

Estimated time to complete: 30-minutes

## Maker 101

### [Writing Digital Output][2]
In this lab you will write to a digital output.

Estimated time to complete: 20-minutes

### [Reading Analog Input][3]
In this lab you will read input from an analog sensor using a voltage divider.

Estimated time to complete: 20-minutes

### [Input Controls Output][4]
In this lab you will use analog input to control digital output.

Estimated time to complete: 20-minutes

## Connected Things 101

### [Sending Data to the Cloud][5]
In this lab you will build a simple ambient light detection app and send the data that is being collected to the Cloud.

Estimated time to complete: 30-minutes

### [Command &amp; Control][6]
In this lab you will build an Arduino circuit that acts as both a message sending device (an ambient light detector) and a command/control receiving device (LED). You will learn how to send command/control messages and how to process them. These are the concepts of connected Things.

Estimated time to complete: 40-minutes

### Connecting Multiple Things[7]
In this lab you will build two Things, and enable one Thing to share its state with the other, which will alter its own state based on the information received. In other words, you will build one connected Thing that controls another Connected Thing.
