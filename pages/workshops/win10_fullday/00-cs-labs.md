# Getting Started
This is a step-by-step guide to preparing your computer for the Windows 10 IoT Labs.

<a class="radius button small" href="{{ site.url }}/workshop/fullday-windows/getting-started/">Estimated time to complete: 20-minutes. Go to  'Getting Started' ›</a>

# Thing 101 Labs

## Setting Up Your Device
In this lab you will install Windows 10 IoT Core on your hardware (select from one of the options below). 

### Raspberry Pi 2
The Raspberry Pi 2 is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. The Raspberry Pi 2 runs Windows 10 IoT Core.

In this lab you will install Windows 10 IoT Core on your Raspberry Pi 2.

### DragonBoard 410c
The DragonBoard™ 410c based on Linaro 96Boards™ specification features the Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 410 processor, a Quad-core ARM® Cortex™ A53 at up to 1.2GHz clock speed per core, capable of 32-bit and 64-bit operation. WLAN, Bluetooth, and GPS, all packed into a board the size of a credit card.

In this lab you will install Windows 10 IoT Core on your DragonBoard 410c.

# Connected Thing Labs
In the labs leading up to this point, you have prepared your hardware and developed a 'Hello, World!' application that you deployed to the board. In this set of labs you will build a new application for Windows 10 IoT Core and connect it to Microsoft Azure IoT Hubs.

## Setting Up Azure IoT Hub
In this lab you will provision a new Azure IoT Hub. Once you have the IoT Hub created, you will be able to create a new Azure IoT device (a software reference to your physical device) that you will use to send telemetry to Azure.

## Sending Telemetry to the Cloud
In this lab you will write an application that collects data from your Windows IoT board and sends it up to your Azure IoT Hub.

# Cloud IoT Service Labs
In these labs you will learn how to use Cloud services to gain insights and derive value from the data you are collecting from your _Thing_.

## Visualizing IoT Data with Power BI
In this lab you will create visualizations of IoT data using Microsoft Power BI.
