Azure IoT Hub only allows connections from known devices that present proper credentials. In this lab series you will use either the _DeviceExplorer_ utility or the _iothub-explorer_ command line interface to provision a device for use in Azure IoT Hub. While Azure IoT Hub supports multiple authentication schemes, you will use pre-shared keys in this lab series.

The simplest way to provision a new device is with the _DeviceExplorer_ utility (Windows only). If you are using Windows, download and run [Device Explorer][deviceexplorer]. After running the installer, the _DeviceExplorer.exe_ can be found at __C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\DeviceExplorer__. When you run the utility you need to input the _iothubowner_ connection strong (from the previous step) in the _IoT Hub Connection String_ field found in the _Configuration_ tab.
