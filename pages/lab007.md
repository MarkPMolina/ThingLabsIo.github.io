In this lab you will send some sensor data to Azure Event Hubs and then process the data using Azure Stream Analytics and visualize the data using Power BI.

## Bill of Materials

What you will need:

1. [Arduino Y&uacute;n](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardYun)
2. USB to micro-USB cable
3. [Photoresistor (5528)](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9088)
4. [10k-Ohm 1/4 Watt resistor](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10969) (Brown-Black-Orange)

For this lab series you are using an Arduino Y&uacute;n. The reason for using this vs. other less expensive Arduino boards is because in future lessons you will make use of the fact that the Arduiono Y&uacute;n has on-board Wi-Fi and a Linux distribution. Neither of those capabilities are needed for this lesson so if you have a different Arduino board (e.g. an Arduino Uno) you can use it. The [SparkFun Inventor's Kit (for Arduino Uno)](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/13154) is a good kit with lots of parts (LEDs, resistors, servos, etc.), but it ships with an Arduino Uno instead of the Y&uacute;n (the Uno doesn't have onboard Wi-Fi or the Linux distribution we will use in later lessons).

## Wiring the Ambient Light Sensor Board
This lesson uses the same wiring configuration from [Lab 2][3], so its possible that you already have most of the wiring done from the previous lesson. if not, wire the Arduino according to the diagram.
