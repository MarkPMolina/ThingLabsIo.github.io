With the package.json file created you can use NPM to pull down the necessary dependencies.

1. Open a terminal window (Mac OS X) or Node.js command prompt (Windows) 
2. Execute the following commands (replace _C:\Development\IoTLabs\MyLab_ with the correct path for your lab working folder where the package.json file resides):

{% highlight text %}
cd C:\Development\IoTLabs\MyLab
npm install
{% endhighlight %}
