# Windows 10 IoT - Connected Nightlight (2-hours)
In this workshop you will begin by learning the basics of working with Windows 10 IoT Core by writing the IoT version of 'Hello, World' Next, you will build a _Thing_ that reads ambient light and turns a light on when it gets dark enough. Once you have the _Thing_ working you will connect it to an Azure IoT Hub. Finally you will create an Azure Stream Analytics job that will process the live data stream and output it to Power  BI for reporting. 

To complete this workshop you will need a Raspberry Pi 2 (power supply, etc.), a microSD card, an LED, a photoresistor, and a couple of resistors. You will also need a Microsoft Azure account (free trial is fine) and you will need a Power BI account to complete the final lab.

Estimated time to complete: 2 hours.

# Thingy 4 Windows (full day)
In these IoT labs, you will begin by learning the basics of working with Windows 10 IoT Core connected to sensors and actuators. You will move on to connecting the Thing to the Cloud. You will learn how to leverage Microsoft Azure services to collect data and control devices and use advanced services like analytics and machine learning to discover insights using your Things.

The goals of this workshop are:

+ Educate developers on the IoT stack offered by Microsoft
+ Educate developers on the Universal Windows Platform (UWP)
+ Educate developers on the Azure services related to IoT

By the end of the workshop a participant will be able to:

+ Build an IoT device using the Raspberry Pi 2 (RPi2)
+ Build a UWP app for Windows IoT Core to run on the RPi2
+ Use Windows IoT Core and the RPi to both capture input and present output
+ Create and configure an Azure IoT Hub to manage device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messaging
+ Connect a UWP application running on the RPi2 to an Azure IoT Hub
+ Build a data pipeline that captures data coming into IoT Hub and stores it
+ Build a visualization of IoT data
+ Build a client application that can send a command to the IoT device via Azure

To complete this workshop you will need:

* Windows 10 development machine
* Visual Studio 2015 Community edition or better
* A Microsoft Azure account
* A Raspberry Pi 2 (power supply, etc.)
* A Class 10 microSD card
* The GrovePi Starter Kit

Estimated time to complete: 6-8 hours.
