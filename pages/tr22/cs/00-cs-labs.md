# Thing 101 Labs
In the first set of labs you will learn the basics of creating a _Thing_ using WIndows 10 IoT Core.

## Hello, Windows IoT!
In this lab you will create a simple _Thing_ using a Raspberry Pi 2 running Windows 10 IoT Core. The Raspberry Pi 2 is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.

# Connected Thing Labs
In the labs leading up to this point, you have prepared your hardware and developed a 'Hello, World!' application that you deployed to the board. In this set of labs you will build a new application for Windows 10 IoT Core and connect it to Microsoft Azure IoT Hubs.

## Setting Up Azure IoT Hub
In this lab you will provision a new Azure IoT Hub. Once you have the IoT Hub created, you will be able to create a new Azure IoT device (a software reference to your physical device) that you will use to send telemetry to Azure.

## Sending Telemetry to the Cloud
In this lab you will write an application that collects data from your Windows IoT board and sends it up to your Azure IoT Hub.

# Cloud IoT Service Labs
In these labs you will learn how to use Cloud services to gain insights and derive value from the data you are collecting from your _Thing_.

## Visualizing IoT Data with Power BI
In this lab you will create visualizations of IoT data using Microsoft Power BI.
