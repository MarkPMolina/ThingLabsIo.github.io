## Amsterdam, Netherlands @ DEVintersection - October 17, 2015
Running Time: 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM. Are you a developer who wants to learn about the Internet of Things (IoT)? Do you want to retrieve data from Internet-connected sensors for applications in home automation, healthcare, automotive, government and more? Do you want to control sensors and devices remotely from cloud, mobile, or desktop applications? In the IoT Fire Starter workshop you will use an IoT prototyping kit (that is yours to keep) to learn how to create micro-controller devices (the ‘Things’ in IoT) that use a variety of physical sensors such as light and temperature sensors; control switches; servos; and motors. You will learn how to connect these Things to Microsoft Azure IoT services to both collect data and issue control commands to the devices. Once you have mastered prototyping the hardware and connecting it to the Cloud, you will learn how to leverage Azure IoT services to gain insight into the data coming from your connected Thing, including analytics and machine learning. Following the workshop you will be able to continue your experience with your prototyping kit by following additional hands-on labs you can subscribe to online. You will need to bring your own laptop for this workshop.
