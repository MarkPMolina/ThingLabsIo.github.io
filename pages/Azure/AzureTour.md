## Getting Started
This is a step-by-step guide to preparing your computer for the Azure IoT Labs.

Estimated time to complete: 30-minutes

[Getting Started =>][getting-started]

## Setting Up Azure IoT Hub
In this lab you will provision an Azure IoT Hub and provision an Azure IoT device.

Estimated time to complete: 30-minutes

[Setting Up Azure IoT and Your Device =>][setup-azure-iot-hub]

## Preparing Your Device
Depending on the device you are using, there are slight differences in how you prepare them and set them up. 

[Preparing Your Arduino][setup-arduino]

[Preparing Your Particle Photon][setup-photon]

## Sending Telemetry to the Cloud
In this lab you will write a Node.js application to collect sensor readings from a _Thing_ and send the data as messages to your Azure IoT Hub.

Estimated time to complete: 30-minutes

[Getting Started =>][5]

## Visualizing IoT Data
In this lab you will create an Azure Stream Analytics job to query data coming in to your Azure IoT hub and stream it out to Power BI. In Power BI you will build visualizations of your IoT data.

Estimated time to complete: 30-minutes

[Getting Started =>][4]

## Coming Soon
More labs will be coming soon to teach you how to send command and control messages to your devices, how to deploy and run the Node.js app from a Raspberry Pi, and how to build a client app that interacts with your IoT devices.
