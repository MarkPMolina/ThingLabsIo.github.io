If you haven't already done so, please follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](/labs/lab000/) lab.

In this lab you will use a photoresistor to create an ambient light sensor. You will send data collected from the ambient light sensor to Nitrogen and process it to determine is the LED should be on or off. You will then send a message indicting the state of the LED after the command is processed. In this lab you are simulating two devices - an ambient light sensor and a light -- with a single Arduino.
  
## Bill of Materials
What you will need (all the parts from the previous lessons):

1. [Arduino Y&uacute;n](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardYun)
2. USB to micro-USB cable
3. [5mm Green LED](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/12062)
4. [330-Ohm 1/4 Watt resistor](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10969) (Orange-Orange-Brown)
5. [Photoresistor (5528)](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9088)
6. [10k-Ohm 1/4 Watt resistor](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10969) (Brown-Black-Orange)

For this lab series you are using an Arduino Y&uacute;n. The reason for using this vs. other less expensive Arduino boards is because in future lessons you will make use of the fact that the Arduiono Y&uacute;n has on-board Wi-Fi and a Linux distribution. Neither of those capabilities are needed for this lesson so if you have a different Arduino board (e.g. an Arduino Uno) you can use it. The [SparkFun Inventor's Kit (for Arduino Uno)](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/13154) is a good kit with lots of parts (LEDs, resistors, servos, etc.), but it ships with an Arduino Uno instead of the Y&uacute;n (the Uno doesn't have onboard Wi-Fi or the Linux distribution we will use in later lessons).

## Wiring the Board
This lessons uses the same wiring configuration from Lab 3, so its possible that you already have most of the wiring done from the previous lesson. if not, wire the Arduino according to the diagram.

### Resistors
The 10k Ohm resistor is one part of the voltage divider, working in partnership with the photoresistor.

The 330 Ohm resistor connects to the negative (shorter) lead of the LED.

### Wires
This is where building a habit of connecting positive (5V) and negative (GND) pins from the Arduino to the breadboard side-rails starts to pay off. In this lab the pin coming from GND to the negative side-rail supports both the photoresistor circuit and the LED circuit.

1. Connect 5V to the red/positive side rail.
2. Connect GND to the blue/negative side rail.
3. Connect the red/positive side rail to one end of the 10k resistor.
4. Connect the other end of the 10k Ohm resistor to both one end of the photoresistor and to analog pin 0 (A0).
5. Connect the other end of the photoresistor to the blue/negative side rail.
6. Connect digital pin 13 to the positive lead of the LED (the longer lead is the positive lead).
7. Connect the other lead from the LED to the 330 Ohm resistor.
8. Connect the other end of the 330 Ohm resistor to the blue/negative side rail.

## Writing the Code
For this lab you will create a new file named <strong>lab005.js</strong> in the same directory as you did in the previous labs. There are no additional dependencies after Lab 4, so we don't need to make any changes to the _package.json_ file.

In the lab005.js file start by declaring the key objects, including variables for the Johnny Five objects and the Nitrogen objects. Replace _YOUR API KEY HERE_ with your actual API key.
<pre>
var five = require ("johnny-five"),
    board, photoresistor,led;
    
var Store = require("nitrogen-file-store"),
    nitrogen = require("nitrogen"),
    service, lightSensor;

var config = {
    host: process.env.HOST_NAME || 'api.nitrogen.io',
    http_port: process.env.PORT || 443,
    protocol: process.env.PROTOCOL || 'https',
    api_key: process.env.API_KEY || 'YOUR API KEY HERE'
};

var LEDPIN = 13;

board = new five.Board();
config.store = new Store(config);
service = new nitrogen.Service(config);
</pre>

Create the lightSensor device for Nitrogen. Notice that unlike Lab 4, in this declaration you are adding _tags_.
<pre>
// Create a new Nitrogen device for the photoresistor
// This device will send data it reads from a sensor
lightSensor = new nitrogen.Device({
    nickname: 'lightSensor',
    name: 'Light Sensor',
    tags: ['sends:_lightState', 'executes:_lightLevel']
});
</pre>
The _tags_ in this declaration indicate the two types of messages this device will deal with.

- _\_lightState_ is a message that the lightSensor device will send.
- _\_lightLevel_ is a message that the lightSensor device will execute

Of course, you don't need the Cloud to turn on and off an LED locally. For this example the lightSensor device is actually playing the part of a lightSensor (the devices that detects ambient light and reports the light level) and a light (or LED) which receives commands (on/off) and reports its state. With that in mind, the light sensor sends the _\_lightLevel_ command, the light/LED executes the _\_lightLevel_ command (e.g. reacts to it) and then sends a _\_lightState_ message.

Next, write the _board.on_ function. Notice that you are definine two Johnny Five objects and injecting them into the REPL.
<pre>
// TODO: service.connect() code goes here
    
    board.on("ready", function() {
        console.log("Board connected...");
    
        // Create a new `photoresistor` hardware instance.
        photoresistor = new five.Sensor({
            pin: 'A0',  // Analog pin 0
            freq: 1000  // Collect data once per second
        });
    
        // Define the LED object using the pin
        led = new five.Led(LEDPIN);
   
        // Inject the `sensor` hardware into the Repl instance's context;
        // Allows direct command line access
        board.repl.inject({
            pot: photoresistor,
            led:led
        });
        
        // TODO: photoresistor.on() goes here
    });

// TODO: Closing bracket for serivce.connect() goes here
</pre>

Before you add the _service.connect()_ and _photoresistor.on()_ functions, you need to learn about the Nitrogen CommandManager.

### The Nitrogen CommandManager
Within the Nitrogen client library, the CommandManager class provides the base infrastructure for command processing within Nitrogen. The CommandManager is responsible for watching the devices message stream and make state changes based on the relevant commands it receives. The CommandManager must be subclassed for each device type that it represents. Each subclass is repsponsible for providing the functionality for four functions.

1. __isRelevant(message)__ - should the subclass care about the message
2. __isCommand(message)__ - should the subclass act on the command in the message
3. __obsoletes(downstreamMsg, upstreamMsg)__ - should the subclass care anymore (e..g has the command already been executed, is it stale, etc.)
4. __executeQueue()__ - perform actions based on the commands deemed appropriate (_activeCommands_)

Start by defineing the CommandManager subclass and it's constructor. Add the following code at the end of the lab005.js file (after the end of the _board.on()_ function):
<pre>
// Create a command manager object and 
// set it's prototype to the generic nitrogen.CommandManager 
function LightManager() {
    nitrogen.CommandManager.apply(this, arguments);
}

LightManager.prototype = Object.create(nitrogen.CommandManager.prototype);
LightManager.prototype.constructor = LightManager;
</pre>

#### Override _isRelevant()_
<code>CommandManager.isRelevant(message)</code>

- __message__: _Object_, The message to test for relevance.

Within the subclass you have to override four functions - _isRelevant()_ is the first of those. This function is responsible for looking at any incoming message and determining if the subclass should even care. For this demo you can assume that if the message is \_lightState or \_lightLevel that the subclass should consider it relevant, but only if it came from this device (i.e. don't consider messages from other devices relevant for now).
<pre>
// Override: CommandManager.isRelevant(message)
// Return true if this message is relevant to the CommandManager
// _lightState and _lightLevel are the messages the LightManager cares about
LightManager.prototype.isRelevant = function(message) {
    var relevant = ( (message.is('_lightState') || message.is('_lightLevel')) &&
                     (!this.device || message.from === this.device.id || message.to == this.device.id) );

    return relevant;
};
</pre>

#### Override _isCommand()_
<code>CommandManager.isCommand(message)</code>

- __message__: _Object_, The message to test to see if it is a relevant command.

The subclass needs to determine if the message received is a command that needs executing. The _isCommand()_ function is used to determne that. For this demo, the criterea is simple - only messages of the type _'\_lightLevel'_ need to be executed (remember the _tags_ set on the _lightSensor_ object?).
<pre>
// Override: CommandManager.isCommand(message)
// Return true if this message is a command that this
// CommandManager should process. 
LightManager.prototype.isCommand = function(message) {
    return message.is('_lightLevel');
};
</pre>

#### Override _obsoletes()_
<code>CommandManager.obsoletes(downstreamMsg, upstreamMsg)</code>

- __downstreamMsg__: _Object_, The downstream message that potentially obsoletes the upstream message.
- __upstreamMsg__: _Object_, The upstream message that is potentially obsoleted by the downstream message.

The obsoletes function is responsible for determining if an upstream message is still, or no longer, relevant. Messages become obsolete if they have already been executed but weren't cleared from the queue or if they are stale (i.e. a downstream message renders the upstream message in question out-of-date). For obsoletes, overrides should start their implementation by calling this function for base functionality. You should obsolete the upstream message if:

- The downstream message of the type _'\_lightState'_, and
- The downstream message is a response to the upstream message, and
- The upstream message is of the type _'\_lightLevel'_

If those statements all return true then the upstream message is no longer relevant and should be considered obsolete. 
<pre>
// Override: CommandManager.obsoletes(downstreamMsg, upstreamMsg)
// Returns true if the given message upstream 
// is obsoleted by the downstream message.
LightManager.prototype.obsoletes = function(downstreamMsg, upstreamMsg) {
    if (nitrogen.CommandManager.obsoletes(downstreamMsg, upstreamMsg))
        return true;

    var value = downstreamMsg.is('_lightState') &&
                downstreamMsg.isResponseTo(upstreamMsg) &&
                upstreamMsg.is('_lightLevel');

    return value;
};
</pre>

#### Override _executeQueue()_
<code>CommandManager.executeQueue()</code>

The executeQueue function is responsible for taking action on any active commands remaining (e.g. isRelevant == true;  isCommand == true; obsoletes == false;). In the executeQueue method you evaluate the activeCommands array and take appropriate action.

Start by validating that the device context is available and there is at least one active command.
<pre>
// Override: CommandManager.executeQueue()
// Executes the active commands in the message queue
LightManager.prototype.executeQueue = function(callback) {
    if (!this.device) return callback(new Error('no device attached to control manager.'));

    var self = this;

    // CommandManager.activeCommands()
    // Returns the array of commands that are currently active for this manager
    var activeCommands = this.activeCommands();

    // Verify there are activeCommands
    if (activeCommands.length === 0) {
        this.session.log.warn('LightManager::executeQueue: no active commands to execute.');
        return callback();
    }
</pre>

Continue by finding the final state that matters. In this lab you are taking in an ambient light reading from the lightSensor device and making a decision to turn an LED on or off. That means all that matters is the latest ambient light value (i.e. the most recent one). Depending on your needs in other use cases, you may want to do something with each active command, so in this lab you will use a _forEach_ loop to iterate through all of the active commands.
<pre>
    var commandIds = [];
    var lightOn;

    // Find the final state and collect all the active command ids
    // You will use them in a moment.
    activeCommands.forEach(function(activeCommand) {
        // Collect active command IDs
        commandIds.push(activeCommand.id);
</pre>

in the loop you will capture the ambientLight value that is defines in the message coming from the lightSensor (the \_lightLevel message). You haven't written the code for the message yet, so you are actually setting the spec for the message here (i.e. you must remember what you call the active command here - in this case the command is names _ambientLight_). 
<pre>
        var light = activeCommand.body.command.ambientLight;
</pre>

While in the loop, set the _ligthOn_ value (true/false) based on a predefined ambientLight threshold (you should use the smae threshold you used in Lab 3), and clode the _forEach_ loop.
<pre>        
        // Determine the final state of the light (on/true or off/false)
        if (light > 350) {
            lightOn = true;
        } else {
            lightOn = false;
        }
    });
</pre>

Now that you have iterated through the activeCommands you can set the state of the LED based on the last value you set _lightOn_ to.
<pre>    
    // Turn the light on or off based on final state
    if (led != null) { // Make sure the led sensor is available before using it
        if(lightOn) { 
           led.on();
        } else { 
           led.off();
        }
    }
</pre>

Now that the _executeQueue_ function has set the state of the LED you need to compose a response (downstream) message to send. The response is a \_lightState message. The _command_ in this message is simply the current _on_ state of the LED (on: true/false). Notice that there is a _response\_to_ value in the message that contains all of the command IDs that this downstream message is in response to. This helps with the _obsoletes_ function as well as providing any message subscribers the information to correlate the response to one or more commands it is in response to.
<pre>
    // This is the response to the _lightLevel command.
    // Notice the response_to is the array of command ids from above. This is used in the obsoletes method above as well.
    var lightMessage = new nitrogen.Message({
        type: '_lightState',
        tags: nitrogen.CommandManager.commandTag(self.device.id),
        body: {
            command: {
                on: lightOn
            }
        },
        response_to: commandIds
    });
</pre>

The last thing to do in the _executeQueue_ function is to send the response/downstream message. Rather than a simple _message.send(session)_ call like in Lab 4, this one will use the full _message.send(session, callback)_ signature. In the callback you need to call _CommandManager.process(message)_ which sets up the message stream to collapse and the message to expire, which dropps it from the queue.
<pre>
    lightMessage.send(this.session, function(err, message) {
        if (err) return callback(err);
        
        console.log("Message sent: " + JSON.stringify(lightMessage));
        
        // let the command manager know we processed this _lightState message by passing it the _isOn message.
        self.process(new nitrogen.Message(lightMessage));

        // need to callback if there aren't any issues so commandManager can proceed.   
        return callback();
    });
};
</pre>

#### Override _start()_
There is one additional function to override which I haven't mentioned until now because it once when the session is started, and that is _CommandManager.start(session, callback)_. This function, as the name implies, starts command processing on the message stream. It fetches all the current messages and starts execution. It also establishes a subscription to handle new messages as they are received. In the _start()_ function you will define a _filter_ that helps identify relevant messages (before _isRelevant_) to help reduce the noise coming into processing. For this lab you will simply set the filter to the device ID of the current context (the _lightSensor_ device). This will scope message for evaluation to only those coming from this device. Obviously in production scenarios where you are working with multiple devices you would want a different filter.
<pre>
// Override: start
// Starts command processing on the message stream using the principal’s session. 
// It fetches all the current messages, processes them, and then starts execution.
// It also establishes a subscription to handle new messages and automatically executes 
// them as they are received.
LightManager.prototype.start = function(session, callback) {

    var filter = {
        tags: nitrogen.CommandManager.commandTag(this.device.id)
    };

    return nitrogen.CommandManager.prototype.start.call(this, session, filter, callback);
};    
</pre>

### Add _session.connect()_
Go back up to where the _board.on()_ function is defined. You should have  _TODO_ comment just prior to the _board.on()_ definition. This is where the _session.connect_ function goes (the _session.connect()_ callback function actually wraps the _board.on()_ function. As you probably recall from Lab 4, the _session.connect()_ function initiates the connection to the Nitrogen service.
<pre>
// Connect the lightSensor device defined above
// to the Nitrogen service instance.
service.connect(lightSensor, function(err, session, lightSensor) {
    if (err) { return console.log('Failed to connect lightSensor: ' + err); }
    
    // Create an instance of the subclassed CommandManager object for the lightSensor
    new LightManager(lightSensor).start(session, function(err, message) { 
        if (err) return session.log.error(JSON.stringify(err)); 
    });
    
    // The entire board.on() function goes here
    
});
</pre> 

In the _session.connect()_ function you create a new instance of the LightManager (the subclassed CommandManager) and pass in the Nitrogen device instance that the LightManager is scoped to, and then invoke the overridden _start()_ function.

### Add _photoresistor.on()_
Inside the _board.on()_ function you should have a _TODO_ to add the _photoresistor.on()_ function. Add the following code in that location.
<pre>
        // Define the event handler for the photo resistor reading
        // The freq value used when the photoresistor was defined
        // determines how often this is invoked, thus controlling
        // the frequency of Nitrogen messages.
        photoresistor.on('data', function() {
            // Capture the ambient light level from the photo resistor
            var lightLevel = this.value;
            
            // Create a Nitrogen Message to send the _lightLevel
            var ambientLightMessage = new nitrogen.Message({
                type: '_lightLevel',
                tags: nitrogen.CommandManager.commandTag(lightSensor.id),
                body: {
                    command: {
                        ambientLight: lightLevel
                    }
                },
                to: lightSensor.id
            });
            
            // Send the message
            ambientLightMessage.send(session);
            
            console.log("Message sent: " + JSON.stringify(ambientLightMessage));
        });
</pre>

This is similare to the Nitrogen message you created in Lab 4, with some differences. First, notice the _type_ is set to _'\_lightLevel'_. This is the message type that you have defined as containing a command to be executed. That means when this message is received by any subscribing device (this same device in this case) the command will be processed and executed as necessary. (As a note, it is by convention to use an undercoer (\_) as the prefix for custom types - types defined by Nitrogen don't use underscores). 

Secondly, notice that the _body_ of the message is defined as a _command_ named _ambientLight_ (this is the command name you used in the _executeQueue()_ function). The value being passed in with that command is the captured _lightLevel_.

Finally, notice the _to_ property of the message. This is used to define the device (by ID) that this message is intended for (in this case, the same device).

## Run the App
That's all the code. You can now connect the Arduino to your laptop and run the app. Open a terminal window (Mac OS) or Node.js command prompt (Windows) and execute the following commands (replace _c:\Development\IoTLabs_ with the path that leads to your lab folder):
<pre>
cd C:\Development\IoTLabs 
node lab005.js
</pre>

You may see a few errors roll by as the board initializes, then you will see upstream and downstream messages start to go by. You should also see the LED turn on if there is not enough ambient light (you can cover and uncover it to see the state changes). Remember, when you defined the Johnny-Five _photoresistor_ object, you defined a 1000 millisecond (1 second) interval for capturing the sensor reading and sending the Nitrogen message. Couple the 1 second interval with Cloud latency and you may see a perceived delay of a couple second before the LED state changes as the result of ambient light changes.

## Conclusion &amp; Next Steps
Congratulations! You have created a Thing that collects input from its physical environment and sends it to the Cloud, and then recieved command/control messages and changes its state accordingly. You can use these concepts to make any number of Connected Things. In an upcoming lab you will work with a partner (or solo with two Arduinos) to enable two separate devices to send messages and receive command.control from one another.

In the next lab you will learn how to visualize the data coming from your connected Thing in a web site or a mobile app.
