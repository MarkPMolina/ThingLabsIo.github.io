## Preparing for the Raspberry Pi 2 IoT Labs
The labs in this series build on each other to enable you to prototype your own Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this lab you will use the Microsoft .NET Framework to build a Universal Windows Platform application that can run on any WIndows 10 device, including a Raspberry Pi2 running Windows 10 IoT Core.

## Bill of Materials
In this lab series you will need the following:

1. [Raspberry Pi 2 - $42.00](http://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Model-Project-Board/dp/B00T2U7R7I/)
2. [5V 2A Switching Power Supply w/ 20AWG 6' MicroUSB Cable - $7.95](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1995)
3. [Jumper wires (Male to Male) - $1.95](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1957)
4. [Jumper wires (Male to Female) - $1.95](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1954)
5. [Photoresistor - $0.95](https://www.adafruit.com/products/161)
6. [Red and Green (or White) LEDs - 25 for $8.00](http://www.adafruit.com/products/297)
7. [A few 330 Ohm resistors - 100 for $3.90](http://www.amazon.com/E-Projects-Resistors-Watt-330R-Pieces/dp/B00BVOR6IS/)
8. [A 10k Ohm resistor - 100 for $4.99](http://www.amazon.com/E-Projects-10k-Resistors-Watt-Pieces/dp/B00BWYS9BA/)
9. [MCP3008 - 8-Channel 10-Bit ADC With SPI Interface](https://www.adafruit.com/product/856)
10. 8GB micro SD card - class 10 or better. Microsoft suggests [this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IVPU786) or [this one](http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-Micro-SDHC-16GB/dp/9966573445).

To make life easy, you can get these components and more in the [Microsoft IoT Pack for Raspberry Pi 2](http://www.adafruit.com/windows10iotpi2) from AdaFruit.

Each lab may require additional components. See the Bill of Materials section at the beginning fo each lab.

## Install a Visual Studio 2015
If you don't already have one installed, install [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/). You can use the free Community edition, or any other highter edition. When you are installing Visual Studio, you must do a __Custom__ install and select to install the __Universal Windows App Development Tools -> Tools and Windows SDK__.

After the installation is complete, install the Windows IoT Core Project Templates from [here](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/55b357e1-a533-43ad-82a5-a88ac4b01dec).

## Enable Developer Mode on your Windows 10 Development Device
When you are developing on Windows 10, you choose what tasks you want to enable on the device. This includes any devices - Windows 10 desktops, tablets and phones. You can enable a device for development, or just app sideloading. To enable _Developer mode_ on your Windows 10 device:

1. Click the Windows icon (typically in the lower-left of the screen, on the left-most side of the toolbar). 
2. Type __Update__ and select _Windows Update settings_ from the _Best match_ list. This will open the __UPDATE & SECURITY__ settings page. 
3. Click on __For developers__ in the left sidebar.
4. Ensure the __Developer mode__ radio button is selected.
5. Save your changes and close the _Settings_ window.  

## Create a Microsoft Azure Trial Account
In this lab series you will use Microsoft Azure as the cloud backend for your IoT solution. If you don't allready have an Azure account, go to [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/) to start a free trial of Microsoft Azure. You may need a credit card for identity verification, but the trial is completely free. If you have an MSDN Subscription you may be eligible for free credits to Microsoft Azure every month. Check your [MSDN account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/) page for details.

That's it for now. You are ready to start the [first set of labs](/rpi2/01/).
