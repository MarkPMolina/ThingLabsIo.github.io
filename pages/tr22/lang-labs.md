In these Labs you will begin by learning the basics of working with a microcontroller unit (MCU) or a microprocessor unit (MPU) and sensors, and move on to connecting them to the Internet. You will learn how to leverage Cloud IoT services to collect data and control devices and use advanced services like streaming analytics to discover insights using your _Thing_.

Depending on the programming language you prefer, you can work your way through a series of labs that will teach you the core concepts for building a _Thing_ and then connecting that Thing to Microsoft Azure. Regardless of the language you choose, you will learn the same IoT concepts.

# Windows 10 IoT &amp; C\#
In these labs you will use Windows 10 IoT Core and C# to write applications for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) running on your _Thing_. These labs require a Windows 10 development machine and Visual Studio 2015 Community (or higher edition).

For these labs you will use the Raspberry Pi 2 and build an application that is deployed onto the _Thing_..

# JavaScript, Node.js and Johnny-Five
In these labs you will use JavaScript to write Node.js applications that control your _Thing_. The applications use an open source framework called Johnny-Five. Johnny-Five is the original JavaScript Robotics programming framework (which also works great for IoT). Released by Bocoup in 2012, Johnny-Five is maintained by a community of passionate software developers and hardware engineers. Over 75 developers have made contributions towards building a robust, extensible and composable ecosystem.

For these labs you will use the Particle Photon and you will build a gateway application that runs on your development machine and communicates with the Photon over TCP.
