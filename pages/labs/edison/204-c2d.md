The code for the final lab has been already created as part of the
previous labs and all we have to do is make the Web app aware
of our IoT Hub to be able to push messages to IoT devices.

## Add IoT Hub Connection String

In the Azure portal, add another App setting called `THINGLABS_IOTHUB_CONNSTRING`
and paste your IoT Hub connection string as the value.

## Use Web UI to toggle LED state

In the Web app UI, there is a form to which you write the ID of your
IoT device. This ID is the one you used when the IoT device was created.
