## About these labs. 
This is a special edition of the Azure IoT Labs with the Particle Photon specifically slimmed down for the Dublin Web Summit at the booth. If you would like to run through the full set of labs on your own, please check out the [Azure IoT Hub with Photon labs][0].

## [Setting Up Azure IoT and Your Device][1]
In this lab you will claim your Particle Photon and provision an Azure IoT device. 

Estimated time to complete: 30-minutes

## [Sending Telemetry to the Cloud][2]
In this lab you will write a Node.js application to collect sensor readings from the Photon and send the data as messages to your Azure IoT Hub.

Estimated time to complete: 30-minutes


## Coming Soon
More labs will be coming soon to teach you how to send command and control messages to your devices, how to deploy and run the Node.js app from a Raspberry Pi, and how to build a client app that interacts with your IoT devices.
