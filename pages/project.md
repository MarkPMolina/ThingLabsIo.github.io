Projects are arranged by programming language and platform. Each lab will specify which hardware is supported.

# JavaScript, Node.js and Johnny-Five
In these projects you will use JavaScript to write Node.js applications that control your _Thing_. The applications use an open source framework called Johnny-Five. Johnny-Five is the original JavaScript Robotics programming framework (which also works great for IoT). Released by Bocoup in 2012, Johnny-Five is maintained by a community of passionate software developers and hardware engineers. Over 75 developers have made contributions towards building a robust, extensible and composable ecosystem.

## Microsoft Azure IoT Connected Weather Station Project
This lab series will teach you how to build a simple Cloud-connected weather station that will send temperature and barometric pressure data to the Cloud. You will use Microsoft Power BI to create reports on the data.

Hardware supported:

* Arduino Uno
* SparkFun RedBoard (programmed with Arduino)
* Particle Photon

# Windows 10 IoT &amp; C\#
In these labs you will use Windows 10 IoT Core and C# to write applications for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) running on your _Thing_. These labs require a Windows 10 development machine and Visual Studio 2015 Community (or higher edition).
