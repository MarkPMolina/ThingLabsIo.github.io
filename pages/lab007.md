## Install Bower
Bower is a package manager similar to the Node Package Manager (NPM). For these labs we will use both NPM and Bower. You install Bower using NPM. 

On Windows, open the Node.js command prompt and type the following:
<pre>
	npm install -g bower
</pre>

On Mac OS X open Terminal and type the following:
<pre>
	sudo npm install -g bower
</pre>

## Install Apache Cordova and Cordova Icon

### Apache Cordova
Apache Cordova is an open-source mobile development framework. It allows you to use standard web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for cross-platform development, avoiding each mobile platforms' native development language. Applications execute within wrappers targeted to each platform, and rely on standards-compliant API bindings to access each device's sensors, data, and network status.

On Windows, open the Node.js command prompt and type the following:
<pre>
npm install -g cordova
</pre>

On Mac OS X open Terminal and type the following:
<pre>
sudo npm install -g cordova
</pre>

### Cordova Icon
Cordova Icon is a tool that provides automatic icon resizing for Cordova apps.

On Windows, open the Node.js command prompt and type the following:
<pre>
npm install -g cordova-icon
</pre>

On Mac OS X open Terminal and type the following:
<pre>
sudo npm install -g cordova-icon
</pre>
