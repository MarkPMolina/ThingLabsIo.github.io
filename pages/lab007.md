In this lab you will send some sensor data to Azure Event Hubs and then process the data using Azure Stream Analytics and visualize the data using Power BI.

## Bill of Materials

What you will need:

1. [Arduino Y&uacute;n](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardYun)
2. USB to micro-USB cable
3. [Photoresistor (5528)](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9088)
4. [10k-Ohm 1/4 Watt resistor](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10969) (Brown-Black-Orange)

For this lab series you are using an Arduino Y&uacute;n. The reason for using this vs. other less expensive Arduino boards is because in future lessons you will make use of the fact that the Arduiono Y&uacute;n has on-board Wi-Fi and a Linux distribution. Neither of those capabilities are needed for this lesson so if you have a different Arduino board (e.g. an Arduino Uno) you can use it. The [SparkFun Inventor's Kit (for Arduino Uno)](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/13154) is a good kit with lots of parts (LEDs, resistors, servos, etc.), but it ships with an Arduino Uno instead of the Y&uacute;n (the Uno doesn't have onboard Wi-Fi or the Linux distribution we will use in later lessons).










## Install Bower
Bower is a package manager similar to the Node Package Manager (NPM). For these labs we will use both NPM and Bower. You install Bower using NPM. 

On Windows, open the Node.js command prompt and type the following:
<pre>
	npm install -g bower
</pre>

On Mac OS X open Terminal and type the following:
<pre>
	sudo npm install -g bower
</pre>

## Install Apache Cordova and Cordova Icon

### Apache Cordova
Apache Cordova is an open-source mobile development framework. It allows you to use standard web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for cross-platform development, avoiding each mobile platforms' native development language. Applications execute within wrappers targeted to each platform, and rely on standards-compliant API bindings to access each device's sensors, data, and network status.

On Windows, open the Node.js command prompt and type the following:
<pre>
npm install -g cordova
</pre>

On Mac OS X open Terminal and type the following:
<pre>
sudo npm install -g cordova
</pre>

### Cordova Icon
Cordova Icon is a tool that provides automatic icon resizing for Cordova apps.

On Windows, open the Node.js command prompt and type the following:
<pre>
npm install -g cordova-icon
</pre>

On Mac OS X open Terminal and type the following:
<pre>
sudo npm install -g cordova-icon
</pre>
