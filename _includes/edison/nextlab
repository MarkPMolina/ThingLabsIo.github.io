*  
*  This include lets you easily display an alert.
*  To use the include no `.html` ending is necessary.
*  You can use five different kinds of alerts:
*
*  - warning
*  - info
*  - success
*  - alert
*  - text
*
*  You can even use <html>-tags inside the alert. Beware:
*  Use " and ' properly. 
*  
*  Example: {% include alert info='Show an info alert with outstanding information' %}
*
