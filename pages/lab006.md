In this lab you will use two Arduinos to create a connection between two devices. The concepts are similar to the previous lab, although you will learn about Permissions to enable two or more devices to engage in communication. The devices you will build are the same as in [Lab 01][2] and [Lab 02][3].
  
## Bill of Materials
What you will need (all the parts from the previous lessons):

1. [Arduino Y&uacute;n][4] x2
2. USB to micro-USB cable
3. [5mm Green LED][5]
4. [330-Ohm 1/4 Watt resistor][6] (Orange-Orange-Brown)
5. [Photoresistor (5528)][7]
6. [10k-Ohm 1/4 Watt resistor][8] (Brown-Black-Orange)

For this lab series you are using an Arduino Y&uacute;n. The reason for using this vs. other less expensive Arduino boards is because in future lessons you will make use of the fact that the Arduiono Y&uacute;n has on-board Wi-Fi and a Linux distribution. Neither of those capabilities are needed for this lesson so if you have a different Arduino board (e.g. an Arduino Uno) you can use it. The [SparkFun Inventor's Kit (for Arduino Uno)][9] is a good kit with lots of parts (LEDs, resistors, servos, etc.), but it ships with an Arduino Uno instead of the Y&uacute;n (the Uno doesn't have onboard Wi-Fi or the Linux distribution we will use in later lessons).

## Wiring the Light Board
This lesson uses the same wiring configuration for the light device (a simple LED indicator light) from [Lab 1][2]. Wire the first Arduino according to the following diagram:

<img src="/images/lab01_bb.png"/>

## Wiring the Ambient Light Sensor Board
The second Arduino uses the same wiring configuration for the ambient light sensor device from [Lab 4][10]. Wire the second Arduino according to the following diagram:
<img src="/images/lab02_bb.png"/>

## Writing the Light Sensor Code
The ambient light sensor device code is very similar to the code you wrote in [Lab 04][10]. Create a new file in the same directory as the other labs and name it <strong>lab06_lightSensor.js</strong>. Following is the code for that file.

<pre>
var five = require ("johnny-five"),
    board, photoresistor;
    
var Store = require("nitrogen-file-store"),
    nitrogen = require("nitrogen"),
    service, lightSensor;

var config = {
    host: process.env.HOST_NAME || 'api.nitrogen.io',
    http_port: process.env.PORT || 443,
    protocol: process.env.PROTOCOL || 'https',
    api_key: process.env.API_KEY || 'YOUR API KEY HERE'
};

board = new five.Board();
config.store = new Store(config);
service = new nitrogen.Service(config);

// Create a new Nitrogen device for the photoresistor
// This device will send data it reads from a sensor
lightSensor = new nitrogen.Device({
    nickname: 'lab06_lightSensor',
    name: 'Lab 06 Light Sensor',
    tags: ['sends:_lightLevel']
});

// Connect the lightSensor device defined above
// to the Nitrogen service instance.
service.connect(lightSensor, function(err, session, lightSensor) {
    if (err) { return console.log('Failed to connect lightSensor: ' + err); }
    
    board.on("ready", function() {
        console.log("Board connected...");
    
        // Create a new `photoresistor` hardware instance.
        photoresistor = new five.Sensor({
            pin: 'A0',  // Analog pin 0
            freq: 1000  // Collect data once per second
        });

        // Inject the 'sensor' hardware into the Repl instance's context;
        // Allows direct command line access
        board.repl.inject({
            pot: photoresistor
        });
        
        // Define the event handler for the photo resistor reading
        // The freq value used when the photoresistor was defined
        // determines how often this is invoked, thus controlling
        // the frequency of Nitrogen messages.
        photoresistor.on('data', function() {
            // Capture the ambient light level from the photo resistor
            var lightLevel = this.value;
            
            // Create a Nitrogen Message to send the _lightLevel
            var ambientLightMessage = new nitrogen.Message({
                type: '_lightLevel',
                tags: nitrogen.CommandManager.commandTag('lab06'),
                body: {
                    command: {
                        ambientLight: lightLevel
                    }
                }
            });
            
            // Send the message
            ambientLightMessage.send(session);
            
            console.log("Message sent: " + JSON.stringify(ambientLightMessage));
        });
    });
});    
</pre>

You should notice two differences.

1. The definition of the <code>lightSensor</code> Nitrogen device includes a <code>tags</code> parameter specifying that this device only sends <code>_lightLevel</code> messages, and doesn't execute any.
2. The <code>tags</code>property of the <code>ambientLightMessage</code> specifies 'lab06' instead of <code>this.device.id</code>. This enables you to set a scoping property (e.g. tag devices for an application). Any device listening to the messaage stream can filter to only the messages with this tag rather than to a single device ID.  

For many IoT scenarios you will create devices that simply send telemetry to Cloud services, and possibly receive command and control messages back (similar to [Lab 05][11]). You won't have a need to have one device control another. In this lab you are designing the Ambient Light Sensor to send telemetry to the Cloud without any knowledge of any users or devices that may be listening to the message stream. In this lab you will create a status indicator device the listens to the message stream of the Ambient Light device. 

## Writing the Code for the Light Device
The light device is a status indicator using a RGB LED connected to digital pins 3 (blue), 5 (green) and 6 (red), plus GND. The indicator light will change color based on the amount of ambient light reported, including glowing bright white when there is the least amount of ambient light. The biggest difference between this and the previous labs is that these are two physically separated boards that will communicate with each via Nitrogen. Create a new file in the same directory as the other labs and name it <strong>lab06_light.js</strong>. Following is the code for that file.
<pre>
var five = require ("johnny-five"),
    board, led;
    
var Store = require("nitrogen-file-store"),
    nitrogen = require("nitrogen"),
    service, indicatorLight;

var config = {
    host: process.env.HOST_NAME || 'api.nitrogen.io',
    http_port: process.env.PORT || 443,
    protocol: process.env.PROTOCOL || 'https',
    api_key: process.env.API_KEY || 'YOUR API KEY HERE'
};

// Define a command tag that you can scope to.
// This will enable you to filter to only relevant messages
var cmdTag = 'lab06';

board = new five.Board({ port: "COM3" });
config.store = new Store(config);
service = new nitrogen.Service(config);

// Create a new Nitrogen device for the photoresistor
// This device will send data it reads from a sensor
indicatorLight = new nitrogen.Device({
    nickname: 'lab06_indicatorLight',
    name: 'Lab 06 Indicator Light',
    tags: ['sends:_color', 'executes:_lightLevel']
});

// Connect the indicatorLight device defined above
// to the Nitrogen service instance.
service.connect(indicatorLight, function(err, session, indicatorLight) {
    if (err) { return console.log('Failed to connect lab06_indicatorLight: ' + err); }
    
    // Create an instance of the subclassed CommandManager object for the indicatorLight
    new LightManager(indicatorLight).start(session, function(err, message) { 
        if (err) return session.log.error(JSON.stringify(err)); 
    });
        
    board.on("ready", function() {
        console.log("Board connected...");
           
        // Initialize the RGB LED
        led = new five.Led.RGB({
            pins: {
                red: 6,
                green: 5,
                blue: 3
            }
        });
   
        // Inject the 'sensor' hardware into the Repl instance's context;
        // Allows direct command line access
        board.repl.inject({
            led:led
        });
    });
});

// Create a command manager object and

function LightManager() {
    nitrogen.CommandManager.apply(this, arguments);
}

LightManager.prototype = Object.create(nitrogen.CommandManager.prototype);
LightManager.prototype.constructor = LightManager;

        return true;

    var value = downstreamMsg.is('_color') &&

    return value;
};

        // Constrain the values to eliminate negative values and values beyond the upper bound

    });
    
    color = r + g + b;
    
    // If the LED is present, set its color value
    if(led != null) {

    }
    
    // This is the response to the _lightLevel command.

</pre>

THe code for the indicator light should be fairly self explanatory if you have done the previous labs. The biggest difference is the use of an RGB LED, not a single color LED. Other than that the use of a sub-classed CommandManager (the <code>LightManager</code>) is basically the same as [Lab05][11]. The new concept that you need to understand to enable distinctly different devices to communicate with each other is Permissions.

## Permissions
Permissions in Nitrogen are pretty much what they sould like. Permissions enable you to define what Nitrogen Principals (users, devices, applications, etc.) can do in relation to other Nitrogen principals. This could include enabling auser to have admin privelages over one or more devices, or giveing a group of devices to the ability to subscribe to the message stream from another device, etc. Permissions are set using the Nitrogen command-line.

For this lab you will give permission to the indicator light device to subscribe to the ambient light device (these devices must be in the same Nitrgen account). This means that the ambient light device doesn't need to know anything about the indicator light device, but the indicator light device will know everything that the ambient light device sends on its message stream. To set the permission you first need to geth the device IDs that Nitrogen is using for each of these devices. To do that, run each of the applications, which will dynamically provision the devices in Nitrogen.

On the machine you have the indicator light device physically connected, open a terminal window (Mac OS) or Node.js command prompt (Windows) and execute the following commands (replace _C:\Development\IoTLabs_ with the path that leads to your labs folder):
<pre>
cd C:\Development\IoTLabs 
node lab06_light.js
</pre>

Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> twice then <kbd>Enter</kbd>to exit the program without closing the window.

On the machine you have the light sensor device physically connected, open a terminal window or Node.js command prompt (or a different terminal/command prompt windoe if you have the devices physically connected to the same machine) and execute the following commands (replace _C:\Development\IoTLabs_ with the path that leads to your labs folder):
<pre>
cd C:\Development\IoTLabs 
node lab06_lightSensor.js
</pre>

Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> twice then <kbd>Enter</kbd>to exit the program without closing the window.

Once the devices have been provisioned you can create a permission using the device IDs. You can get the device IDs by executing the following command in terminal/Node.js command prompt.
<pre>
n2 device ls
</pre>

You should see something similar to the following (depending on what devices you have):
<pre>
C:\Development\IoTLabs>n2 device ls
ID                        TYPE    NAME                     LAST IP          LAST CONNECTION
555cabbb1bd28701000c95ec  device  Lab 06 Light Sensor      24.248.182.246   2015-05-20T16:37:51.064Z
555cabbe1bd28701000c9633  device  Lab 06 Indicator Light   24.248.182.246   2015-05-20T16:37:51.020Z    
</pre>

Using the values in the ID column for the appropriate devices, execute a command in the following format(this only needs to be done once, and can be done from the Terminal/Node.js Command Prompt of either device):
<pre>
    n2 permission add --action subscribe --authorized true --issuedTo YOUR INDICATOR LIGHT DEVICE ID HERE --principalFor YOUR AMBIENT LIGHT DEVICE ID HERE
</pre>

This command is telling Nitrogen to create a permission that allows the indicator light device to subscribe to the message stream from the ambient light device. There are five (5) options for the type of permission (the <code>action</code>) that can be created.

1. __(empty)__: issuedTo is authorized to perform all actions on principalFor.
2. __admin__: issuedTo is authorized to perform administrative operations on principalFor.
3. __send__: issuedTo is authorized to send messages to principalFor.
4. __subscribe__: issuedTo is authorized to subscribe to messages from principalFor.
5. __view__: issuedTo is authorized to see principalFor in searches.

You can also use <code>authorized</code> argument to either give or deny the specified permission (e.g. deny a device permission to subscribe to another device).

## Run the Apps
Now that you have the permission in place you can run both apps and see the indicator light device change state based on the telemetry sent by the ambient light device.
On the machine you have the indicator light device physically connected, open a terminal window (Mac OS) or Node.js command prompt (Windows) and execute the following commands (replace _C:\Development\IoTLabs_ with the path that leads to your labs folder):
<pre>
cd C:\Development\IoTLabs 
node lab06_light.js
</pre>

On the machine you have the light sensor device physically connected, open a terminal window or Node.js command prompt (or a different terminal/command prompt windoe if you have the devices physically connected to the same machine) and execute the following commands (replace _C:\Development\IoTLabs_ with the path that leads to your labs folder):
<pre>
cd C:\Development\IoTLabs 
node lab06_lightSensor.js
</pre>

Play around with changing the amount of light the ambient light sensor reports. You should see the indicator light change state, although there will be some latency in the response because the ambient light sensor is reading data in one-second intervals, and the impact of network latency.

For each device, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> twice then <kbd>Enter</kbd>to exit the program without closing the window.

## Conclusion &amp; Next Steps
Congratulations! You hace not created two connected Things and caused one of them to change state based on the telemetry (in the form of a message stream) of another device. Through these labs you have now been exposed to most of the concepts you need to build connected Things. In the next lab you will learn how to pull the data you are collecting from your Things and visualize it in an application. In an upcoming lab you will learn how to deploy your application to the Arduino Yun so that it can operate as an autonomous device without a laptop connected to it.
